IG-GI - Web Application based on React.js, Redux and Firebase.

Preview: ig-gi.surge.sh

An app will let you quickly display, browse, search for the Glycemic Index for different foods and drinks.
We want to build an application, where users can register to their profiles, has list of foods and drinks dedicated to their own diet. Groceries will be separate by specific groups. Any single item will have number from 0 -100 which represents the level of glucose in blood.
